		               DESIGN AND DEVELOP AN APPLICATION TO CALCULATE THE AREAS OF GEOMETRICAL SHAPES

1) WITHOUT OOPS

IN THIS I HAVE TAKEN THREE GEOMETRICAL SHAPES SQUARE,RECTANGLE AND CIRCLE

PROCEDURE-
* CREATE THREE CLASSES SQUARE,RECTANGLE AND CIRCLE AND GIVE THEIR DATA MEMBERS AND THEIR BEHAVIOURS THROUGH METHODS 
* METHODS- acceptInput() , compute() , disp().
* CREATE A MAIN CLASS
* MAKE THE OBJECT OF EACH CLASS 
* CLASS THE THREE METHODS OF EACH CLASS USING THEIR REFRENCES 



2) WITH OOPS

IN THIS  ALSO I HAVE TAKEN THREE GEOMETRICAL SHAPES SQUARE,RECTANGLE AND CIRCLE

PROCEDURE-
* CREATE THREE ABSTRACT CLASSES SQUARE,RECTANGLE AND CIRCLE AND GIVE THEIR DATA MEMBERS AND THEIR BEHAVIOURS THROUGH METHODS 
* DATA MEMBERS NEED TO BE DEFINED AS PRIVATE TO RESTRICT DIRECT ACCESS.
* METHODS- acceptInput() , compute() , disp().
* CREATE A SHAPE CLASS THAT IS THE PARENT CLASS  OF ALL THREE CLASSES .
* THE THREE CLASSES WILL EXTEND THE SHAPE CLASSES .
* CREATE ANOTHER CLASS CALLED AS GEOMETRY CLASS WHICH HAVE A METHOD CALLED PERMIT TO ACCEPT THE SHAOE REFERNECE 
* FINALLY CREATE A MAIN CLASS AND MAKE THE OBJECT OF THE THREE SHAPES CLASS 
*MAKE OBJECT OF THE GEOMETRY CLASS AND CALL THE PERMIT METHOD WITH THE HELP IF REFRENCE
